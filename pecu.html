        This was a project I've been working on over the course of several years of changes and playtesting. A tabletop system based off of the popular anime
      "Jojos Bizarre Adventures" that I've taken to calling the "Peculiar Journeys" system. I have all of the different editions documented so I can look back and
      see how much it has changed from being some text in a notes app on my phone to the fully completed version it is now. This shows my dedication
      to worldbuilding because of my experience with tabletop games, as I've had to run several different games to playtest the system and made new and engaging
      stories for each section.

        After making my other TTRPG system, Detentions & Delinquents, I actually want to remake this system again into a fifth edition. Which is to be expected,
      as I had started Peculiar Journeys as a sort of mod for 5e and didn't expect to actually really share it much outside of that. Because of this the system
      is a little crude, though still fun to play from time to time with my friends. The Peculiar Journeys Fifth Edition will be on my list of passion projects.
